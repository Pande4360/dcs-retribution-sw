description:
  Proving highly adaptable, the F-4 entered service with the Navy in 1961
  before it was adopted by the United States Marine Corps and the United States Air
  Force, and by the mid-1960s it had become a major part of their air arms. Phantom
  production ran from 1958 to 1981 with a total of 5,195 aircraft built, making it
  the most produced American supersonic military aircraft in history, and cementing
  its position as an iconic combat aircraft of the Cold War. The F-4 was used extensively
  during the Vietnam War. It served as the principal air superiority fighter for the
  U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps and became important in the ground-attack
  and aerial reconnaissance roles late in the war.
