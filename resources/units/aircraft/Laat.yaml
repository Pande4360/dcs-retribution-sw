description:
  The Low Altitude Assault Transport, or LAAT, was a line of gunship used by the Grand Army of the Republic. 
  Models in the line included the Low Altitude Assault Transport carrier designed to transport 
  a single All Terrain Tactical Enforcer and the Low Altitude Assault Transport/infantry that served 
  mainly as a gunship and troop transport.[3] Space gunships[8] were a variant of the Low Altitude Assault 
  Transport/infantry designed to function in space.[20] The Coruscant Guard and Imperial Military also used 
  a variant called the LAAT/le patrol gunship.
