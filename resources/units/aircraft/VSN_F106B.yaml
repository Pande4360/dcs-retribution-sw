description:
  "The Convair F-106 Delta Dart is a supersonic interceptor that served with \
  \ the United States Air Force from 1959 to 1988. Capable of Mach 2.3 it was \
  \ envisioned as the ultimate interceptor. The F-106 was designed without a \
  \ gun or provision for carrying bombs, instead carrying its AIM-4 Falcon \
  \ air-to-air missiles within an internal weapons bay, its clean exterior was \
  \ beneficial to supersonic flight."
